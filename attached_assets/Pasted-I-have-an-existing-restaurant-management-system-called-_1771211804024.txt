I have an existing restaurant management system called "Cafe Twenty Twenty" built with React frontend and a backend (likely Node.js/Express) connected to MongoDB Atlas.

CURRENT SETUP:
- MongoDB Cluster: queuecafe
- Database: shubhamcafe
- Collection: users
- Current admin user exists with:
  - username: "admin"
  - password: "admin123" (currently hashed in database)
- Login UI already exists (React component)

REQUIREMENT:
I need to add a "Change Password" feature that allows the admin user to change their own password after logging in. This should be a self-service feature within the admin dashboard.

IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:

1. BACKEND API ENDPOINTS:
   - POST /api/change-password
   - Accepts: { currentPassword, newPassword, confirmPassword }
   - Validates current password matches database
   - Hashes new password with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
   - Updates password in MongoDB users collection
   - Returns success/error JSON response
   - Add proper error handling and validation

2. FRONTEND REACT COMPONENT:
   - Create "ChangePassword.jsx" component
   - Form with three fields:
     * Current Password (password input)
     * New Password (password input)
     * Confirm New Password (password input)
   - Password strength indicator (optional but recommended)
   - Validation rules:
     * Current password cannot be empty
     * New password minimum 8 characters
     * New password must contain: uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
     * New password and confirm password must match
     * New password must be different from current password
   - Submit button with loading state
   - Success/error message display
   - Professional UI matching the existing Cafe Twenty Twenty design (clean, modern, centered card layout similar to login page)

3. SECURITY FEATURES:
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing
   - Validate old password before allowing change
   - Add rate limiting to prevent brute force (max 5 attempts per 15 minutes)
   - Clear form after successful password change
   - Automatically logout user after password change (force re-login with new password)
   - Sanitize all inputs

4. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Add a "Change Password" link/button in the admin dashboard navigation
   - Route: /admin/change-password
   - Protect the route (only accessible when logged in)
   - Use existing authentication middleware if available
   - Maintain consistency with existing UI/UX design patterns

5. DATABASE OPERATIONS:
   - Connect to MongoDB using existing connection
   - Find user by username from authenticated session
   - Update password field in users collection
   - Add "passwordUpdatedAt" timestamp field
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing user schema

6. DEPENDENCIES (if not already installed):
   - Backend: express, mongoose, bcrypt, express-rate-limit
   - Frontend: react, axios (or fetch API)

7. USER FLOW:
   Step 1: Admin logs in with current credentials (existing functionality)
   Step 2: Admin navigates to "Change Password" page
   Step 3: Admin enters current password, new password, and confirms new password
   Step 4: System validates inputs and current password
   Step 5: System updates password in database
   Step 6: System shows success message
   Step 7: System logs out admin (redirect to login page)
   Step 8: Admin logs in with new password

8. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Display clear error messages for:
     * Incorrect current password
     * Weak new password
     * Password mismatch
     * Database errors
     * Network errors
   - Don't reveal whether user exists in error messages (security)

9. OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Password strength meter with visual feedback (weak/medium/strong)
   - Show/hide password toggle icons
   - Prevent password reuse (check against last 3 passwords)
   - Send email notification after password change
   - Add CAPTCHA for additional security

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Match the existing "Cafe Twenty Twenty Management System" login page design
- Use same color scheme and styling
- Center the form in a card layout
- Include the Cafe Twenty Twenty logo
- Professional, clean, modern UI
- Mobile responsive

CODE ORGANIZATION:
- Backend: Create separate route file (routes/passwordRoutes.js) and controller (controllers/passwordController.js)
- Frontend: Create component in appropriate folder (components/ChangePassword.jsx or pages/ChangePassword.jsx)
- Add proper comments and documentation
- Follow existing project structure and coding standards

TESTING CHECKLIST:
□ Can login with current credentials
□ Can access change password page after login
□ Validation works for all fields
□ Cannot use current password as new password
□ Password successfully updates in database
□ Can login with new password after change
□ Old password no longer works
□ Error messages display correctly
□ UI is responsive on mobile
□ Rate limiting works

Please provide complete, production-ready code with:
- Full backend API implementation
- Complete React component with styling
- Integration instructions
- Security best practices implemented
- Clear comments and documentation
- Error handling throughout

Make the code beginner-friendly with clear variable names and explanations.
