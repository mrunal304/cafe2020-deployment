Fix Database Schema & Booking Creation LogicFIX DATABASE SCHEMA AND BOOKING CREATION LOGIC

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Database has wrong fields (queueNumber, originalQueueNumber)
- Queue numbers don't reset daily (showing 32, 168, etc.)
- Need two separate numbering systems

REQUIRED DATABASE SCHEMA:

Remove these fields if they exist:
- queueNumber
- originalQueueNumber

Update Booking Model to:
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  phoneNumber: String,
  numberOfPeople: Number,
  
  dailySerialNumber: Number,      // Admin tracking: 1, 2, 3... (all bookings today)
  activeQueuePosition: Number,    // Customer display: real-time waiting position
  
  bookingDate: Date,              // Date only (time = 00:00:00) for filtering
  bookingDateTime: Date,          // Full timestamp with exact booking time
  status: String,                 // "waiting", "called", "confirmed", "completed", "cancelled"
  
  message: String,
  notificationSent: Boolean,
  notificationStatus: String,
  calledAt: Date,
  respondedAt: Date,
  responseDeadline: Date,
  responseType: String,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}


BOOKING CREATION LOGIC:

When a new booking is created:

Step 1: Get today's date (strip time, set to 00:00:00)
```javascriptconst bookingDate = new Date();
bookingDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

Step 2: Calculate dailySerialNumber (count ALL bookings today)
```javascriptconst totalTodayBookings = await Booking.countDocuments({
bookingDate: bookingDate
});
const dailySerialNumber = totalTodayBookings + 1;

Step 3: Calculate activeQueuePosition (count only ACTIVE bookings)
```javascriptconst activeTodayBookings = await Booking.countDocuments({
bookingDate: bookingDate,
status: { $in: ["waiting", "called", "confirmed"] }
});
const activeQueuePosition = activeTodayBookings + 1;

Step 4: Create booking with both numbers
```javascriptconst newBooking = await Booking.create({
name: customerName,
phoneNumber: phoneNumber,
numberOfPeople: partySize,
dailySerialNumber: dailySerialNumber,        // e.g., 15 (15th booking today)
activeQueuePosition: activeQueuePosition,    // e.g., 5 (5th person waiting)
bookingDate: bookingDate,
bookingDateTime: new Date(),
status: "waiting",
message: customerMessage || "",
notificationSent: false,
createdAt: new Date(),
updatedAt: new Date()
});

VERIFICATION:
After implementing, test by creating 3 bookings on the same day:
- Booking 1: dailySerialNumber = 1, activeQueuePosition = 1
- Booking 2: dailySerialNumber = 2, activeQueuePosition = 2
- Booking 3: dailySerialNumber = 3, activeQueuePosition = 3

Check database to confirm both fields are saved correctly.

Please implement this database schema update and booking creation logic first.
