"Implement functionality to automatically move booking data from Active Queue to Recent Activity when confirmed.
Requirement
When admin clicks the "Finish" button on a CONFIRMED booking:

Remove the booking from Active Queue display
Add the same booking to Recent Activity section
Display with green "CONFIRMED" status badge
Preserve all booking data (booking #, customer name, phone, party size, message, date & time)

Implementation Steps
Step 1: Update Booking Status
When "Finish" button is clicked:
javascriptasync function finishBooking(bookingId) {
  // Update status to COMPLETED
  await db.query(
    `UPDATE bookings 
     SET status = 'COMPLETED', 
         completed_at = NOW() 
     WHERE id = ? AND status = 'CONFIRMED'`,
    [bookingId]
  );
}
Step 2: Active Queue Filter Query
Active Queue should ONLY show bookings that are NOT completed:
sqlSELECT * FROM bookings 
WHERE status IN ('PENDING', 'CONFIRMED') 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
Step 3: Recent Activity Query
Recent Activity should ONLY show completed/cancelled bookings:
sqlSELECT * FROM bookings 
WHERE status IN ('COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED') 
ORDER BY completed_at DESC, cancelled_at DESC;
Step 4: Frontend Auto-Refresh
After clicking "Finish" button:
javascriptconst handleFinish = async (bookingId) => {
  // Call API to finish booking
  await fetch(`/api/bookings/${bookingId}/finish`, { method: 'PUT' });
  
  // Refresh Active Queue (booking will disappear)
  await fetchActiveQueue();
  
  // Refresh Recent Activity (booking will appear here)
  await fetchRecentActivity();
};
```

## **Expected Result**

**Before clicking Finish:**
- Active Queue: Shows booking #39 with CONFIRMED status
- Recent Activity: Does not show booking #39

**After clicking Finish:**
- Active Queue: Booking #39 disappears (removed from list)
- Recent Activity: Booking #39 appears with green "CONFIRMED" badge

## **Data Flow**
```
Active Queue (status = CONFIRMED)
         ↓
   Click "Finish"
         ↓
Update status = 'COMPLETED'
         ↓
Remove from Active Queue filter
         ↓
Add to Recent Activity filter
         ↓
Recent Activity (display as "CONFIRMED")
Key Points
✅ Do NOT delete the record from database
✅ Only UPDATE the status field
✅ Filter queries automatically handle display
✅ Refresh both sections after status change
✅ Show as "CONFIRMED" (not "COMPLETED") in Recent Activity
Implement this so bookings seamlessly move from Active Queue to Recent Activity when finished."
